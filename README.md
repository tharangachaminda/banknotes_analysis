# Banknotes Authentication

In this python project, I am trying to build a Classification Machine Learning model to predict banknotes are genuine or forged. 

### Purpose
In real world this could mainly be any of the followings.
- Fraud detection
- counterfeit detection
- quality control
- authentication of banknotes

<a id="bu-business-impact"></a>
### Business Impact
There are several valuable Business Impacts and Pottential Benefits which we can define here.
1. Reducing finantial losses
2. Improve customer trust
3. Enhancing operational efficiency
4. or meeting any regulatory requirements

### Stackholders
For this project stackholders possibly be
- any Banking system
- finantial institutions
- law enforcement agencies
- or any regulatory bodies

### Data Sources
This project is based on [Bank Notes Authentication UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/267/banknote+authentication) dataset. I'm using the [Kaggle's version](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ritesaluja/bank-note-authentication-uci-data) of it.

### Technology and Tools
I will be using 
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** for classification banknotes.
- Various **Python libraries** to visualize different insights along the way

### Analytic Techniques
**Descriptive Statistics** wil be used to derive valueable insights from the data.

Following **Machine Learning algoritms** will be evaluated and select the best performing model as the final model.
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. KNN Classifire
4. Support Vector Machine Classifire


## Installation

I have used [*pyforest*](https://pypi.org/project/pyforest/) library bundle for this project.

```bash
  !pip install pyforest
```
    
## üèÜ Lessons Learned

1. Hyperparameter tuning using *GridSearchCV()*
2. Foundation Methodology for Machine Learning Project
